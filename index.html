        <h3>Semester Overview</h3>
<p>At the conclusion of this semester, our team of three collaborators came together to enhance the existing webpage for the South Bend Reparatory Justice Commission. This project has been a testament to our growth, both as individuals and as a team. We embraced the opportunity to explore tools such as Wix, Figma, and Squarespace to reimagine the website's user experience.</p>

<h3>End of the Semester Reflection</h3>
<p>This semester was pivotal in refining our skills and deepening our understanding of the web development process. While no coding was required, we gained valuable experience in design, prototyping, and iterative development. We also strengthened our ability to communicate effectively and manage feedback cycles with our client.</p>

<p>Figma became an essential tool for conceptualizing and refining our designs, ensuring that the website improvements aligned with the Commission's mission and user needs. Squarespace and Wix enabled us to implement these designs efficiently, providing user-friendly interfaces and streamlined workflows.</p>

<p>These past months were not only about technical enhancements but also about fostering collaboration, improving problem-solving skills, and embracing a culture of continuous growth. As a team, we strengthened our communication and adaptability, skills that are crucial in navigating collaborative projects.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the insights and experiences gained during this semester will serve as a solid foundation for future projects, empowering us to continue creating impactful and meaningful solutions.</p>

<h3>Teamwork</h3>
<p>Over 13 weeks, our team met biweekly to coordinate efforts and ensure steady progress. We experimented with approaches like '<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm'>divide and conquer</a>' and '<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming'>mob programming</a>,' ultimately finding that 'divide and conquer' was the most effective strategy. By breaking tasks into manageable segments, we fostered individual ownership and accountability while ensuring that each member could contribute meaningfully to the project.</p>

<p>This approach allowed us to stay organized, meet deadlines, and maximize our productivity, all while catering to our diverse working styles. It was a valuable exercise in teamwork and collective problem-solving.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Our project began with an in-depth review of the existing website, identifying areas for improvement in terms of design, navigation, and user engagement. By establishing clear goals and leveraging tools like Figma for prototyping, we laid the foundation for a successful redesign process.</p>
